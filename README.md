2. Objectives: Navigate through a barrage of enemy ships and asteroids, dodging their fire and avoiding collisions, to reach the end of each level

3. Game elements: Keep an eye on your Health and Lives. Health decreases when your ship gets hit by enemy fire or collides with other ships or asteroids. Lives are lost when you let enemy ships escape your firepower
